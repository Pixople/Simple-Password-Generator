Hey! This is a super simple Python password generator which uses IF statements and the Tinker UI import to show how simple coding skills can be used to make useful cybersecurity advances! 

Passwords are the first layer of defence for all accounts, and randomising and having longer passwords allows you to restrict use of your account and make it harder and harder for non-authenticated users to access your account. 

In the future, I would like to add a save feature, but that is an effort I, at this time, don't feel like doing... lol
